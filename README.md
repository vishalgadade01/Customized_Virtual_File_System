# Virtual File System Project

This project implements a simple virtual file system in C,
which provides basic file operations such as creation, reading, writing, and deletion. 
The project mimics a basic filesystem with features like file table management, inode management, and user file descriptor table management.



## Features

- Create, read, write, and delete files
- List files in the virtual filesystem
- Display file statistics
- Change file offsets for reading and writing
- Manage file permissions (read, write, read & write)
